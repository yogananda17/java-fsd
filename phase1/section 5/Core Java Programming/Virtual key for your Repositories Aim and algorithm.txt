->created a git Repository
->And project pushed to my git Repository.



*Aim:write a program in java to create virtual key for your repositories


*Algorithm:
Step 1:Start the program
Step 2:Give pakage import java.io.File
Step 3:Give Scanner to take input from keyboard
Step 4:use while condition to perform the functions
Step 5:use Switch case 
Step 6:First sort the files in ascending order
Step 7:perform user specified operations
Step 8:perform add,delete and search operations
Step 9:If enter wrong input display retry
Step 10:stop the program.

*core concepts used in this project:
